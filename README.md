### Local Execution

This project demands some environment variables.

First, you will need to install the packages in `package.json` using your preferred package manager (I'm using *yarn*).  

To start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
yarn start
```
Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

#### For Android

```bash
yarn android
```

#### For iOS

```bash
yarn ios
```
This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
